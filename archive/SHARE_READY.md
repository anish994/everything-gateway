Hey [Name],

I just launched a new project I've been working on called "The Everything Gateway" - it's basically a single portal to organize and access the entire internet.

Instead of having scattered bookmarks, you get instant access to:
• 195+ curated resources across 4 categories
• Beautiful, fast interface with universal search
• Everything from search engines to AI tools to streaming platforms

It's completely free and works great on mobile too.

Take a look: [YOUR_LIVE_URL]

Would love to hear what you think!

Best,
Anish
